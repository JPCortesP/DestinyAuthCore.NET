# DestinyAuthCore.NET
Example of a .NET Core implementation of the new Bungie Auth

This is a simple example of how to use the new Bungie OAuth authentication in .NET. 
This example is made in .NET Core, but should work as a base for anything else C#.

Please note the following:

-  __Is not meant to be highly secure__. Just Works
-  I'm not using any best practices or something like that. Again, just works.
- Any question related to this, should be made on GitHub, or the Bungie.net's dev community.

Somehow my project creation flow managed to avoid licensing stuff. __This is MIT licensed__.
